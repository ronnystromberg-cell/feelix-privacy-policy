Privacy Policy for feelix

Last Updated: November 3, 2025

Ronny ("I," "me," or "my") operates the feelix mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my App.

Data Collection and Use

The feelix app is designed with your privacy in mind. It does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information or user-generated content (such as journal entries). All data you create within the App is stored exclusively on your own device and is not transmitted to me or any third party.

The App does not require an internet connection for its core journaling features. An internet connection is only used to access optional, non-personal features such as the "daily facts" API. No personal data is sent during these requests.

Voluntary Donations 

The App includes an external link to Buy Me a Coffee for users who wish to make a voluntary donation. If you choose to donate, you will be taken to a third-party website. Any information you provide on that website (such as your email or payment details) is processed by that third party and is not collected, seen, or stored by the feelix app.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
