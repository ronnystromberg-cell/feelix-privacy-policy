Privacy Policy for feelix

Last Updated: Nov. 24, 2025

Ronny ("I," "me," or "my") operates the feelix mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my App.

1. Data Privacy and Storage

The feelix app is designed with your privacy as its top priority.

No Data Collection: The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personally identifiable information or user-generated content (such as journal entries, notes, or custom metrics).
Local Storage Only: All data you create within the App is stored exclusively in your device's local storage. It is never sent to me or any third party.
Offline Functionality: The App's core journaling features are fully functional without an internet connection.

2. User Control and Responsibility

You have complete control over your data. However, because all data is stored only on your device, you are also solely responsible for its security and backup.

Data Control: The App provides features that allow you to export a complete backup of your data, import a backup to restore your data, and permanently delete all your data at any time through the settings screen.

Risk of Data Loss: As I do not store your data, I cannot recover it for you if it is lost. Data will be permanently lost if you uninstall the app, clear your browser/application data, or lose/damage your device. It is strongly recommended that you use the export feature regularly to create backups.

3. Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. While the app has been tested, I cannot guarantee that it will be completely free of errors or bugs.

No Warranties: I expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
Limitation of Liability: You use the App at your own sole risk. In no event shall I be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of data, arising out of the use or inability to use the App, even if I have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

4. Voluntary Donations

The App includes an external link to a third-party website (e.g., "Buy Me a Coffee") for users who wish to make a voluntary donation. If you choose to donate, any information you provide is processed directly by that third-party service according to their own privacy policy. This information is not collected, seen, or stored by the feelix app.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of the App after any modifications to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified policy.
